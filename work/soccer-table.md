Soccer Table is a component that automatically gets data from [football-data.org](http://http://football-data.org/) using Fetch API.

Right now (_10.2016_) there is only **Serie A** table generated, but I'm planning to redesign this project a little to make it easily swithable between different leagues and soccer tournaments.

My biggest achivement in this project was learning about Fetch API and how it works, as well as getting myself more familiar with _React ecosystem_.

Code is available on  [github](https://github.com/renopeno/soccer-tables)
