<h2 class="title">My first JavaScript little project</h2>

<div class="project-portfolio-image-post">

  </a>
</div>

This was first project I decided to code from scratch in JavaScript. I know it isn't perfect, and isn't even finished as a project, but it helped me practice manipulating DOM with JavaScript.

Styling was applied with CSS, as I didn't use SASS at that time.
I **didn't want to use jQuery** for it, and I'm fairly happy with the result.

This is just a reminder for my future self, to see how much have I improved my JavaScript skills.

Here is my code hosted on [codepen](http://codepen.io):
